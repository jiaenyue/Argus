# This file is intended to be generated from pyproject.toml using a tool like 'uv pip compile'.
# For example: uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
# Manually listing core dependencies here for environments that use requirements.txt directly.

pandas>=1.5,<3.0
pyarrow>=10.0,<16.0

# Note: xtquant is a special dependency provided by the miniQMT environment.
# It should be installed separately or be part of the base Docker image if containerizing.

# Airflow and its provider dependencies are typically managed by the Airflow Docker image
# or installation method and are not listed here if this requirements.txt is solely for the collector's own code.
# If this project directly managed an Airflow installation from scratch, they would be included in pyproject.toml.
